# Java Programming Masterclass updated to Java 17
## Day1
I was informed about the content, operation and up-to-dateness of the course and I made the installations of JDK.
--Slides
## Day2

We started with a tradition, when we're learning a new programming language, to create a simple program that outputs the text, "Hello World".
I learned printing string literal to the screen and reasons of some errors
--Slide hello word
I also learned the variables, data types and Expressions by deeping into java documents.
--Address
--Slide

## Day3

I learned the mean of the "expression" with some challenges
--slides

We started to learn data types with Primitive Types in Java. It is explained the process declaring datatypes and what consequences will be in Ram after declaring. It is also explained the ranges of data types(numerical e.g int). We talked about classes and wraper classes. We talked about Wraparound(overflow or underflow) when the number goes out of the range
--slides

It is explained the ranges of byte, short, int and long and It is also explained suffixes(e.g 'L') and "incompatible types: possible lossy conversion from int to short" error
--slides

We talked about casting, the importance of casting and the cause why we need to use casting.
--slides

It is challenged to us and We solved it 
--slides

## Day4

it is explaned the Float and Double Primitives in Java (casting, precise, range, suffixes, memory and more)
--slides

We talked about floating precision and a Challange.
--slides

We talked about The char and boolean Primitive Data Types (includes unicode)
--slides

We reviewed the Primitive Types in Java and learned String (that is not Primitive Types but class). We talkod about string and the features of string (immutable etc.)

## Day5

We talked about Operators, Operands, Expressions, and Abbreviationg operators.

--slides

## Day6

We downloaded Intellij Idea that is an IDE to make our job easier.
--slides

We created our First Class called as "Hello World" with traditional way.
--slides

## Day7

It is explained the conditional statements, and operators (logical, assignment, equals to, ternary)

--slides

It is explained the some keywords and Class

We also did a challenge

## Day8

After we started IntelliJ IDEA (IDE) with basic introduction, We contiuned with actual terms that are Keywords and Expressions, Statements, Code Blocks and If-else

--slides

Also we've made a basic challenge

## Day9

We've started to learns methods in Java. Method is the one of the most important terms in OOP. It is also explained the return types of the methods and the functionality of returning data from method.

--slides

Also, It is mentioned comparing the codes with other codes or previous version of code in condition executing problems

--slides

## Day10

I've started the exercises and figured out

--slides

## Day11

I've learned "Method Overloading" in java by solving exercises and challanges. I've also finished chapter 5

--slides

## Day12

I've started to learn Chapter 6 that is Control Flow. It was started with an introduction. It is said that We would learn switch-case,enchanced switch-case expression, for loop, while loop, and do-while loop. I've finished switch-cases part and for part by soluting the exercises. 

--slides

## Day13

I've finished while, do-while loop part by soluting some challanges and exercises

--slides

## Day14

I've finished the Chapter 6.

--slides



## Day15

I've started the Chapter 7 that is the OOP Part1 - Inheritance


--slides 
I've learned basis of Object Oriented Programming which is one of the most important and must known thing in Java Programming Language. 
(field, behaviour, package, private, public, ...)

--slides

I've learned getter, setter, and creating the objects

--slides
## Day16

I've continued learning from where I left off. I've seen constructor, static vs instance, and some basis of Inheritance. I also solved couple of exercises.

--slides

## Day17

I've finished the part1 of inheritance and I' ve started to learn String methods such as, manipulation, comparison, and looking up

--slides

## Day18

I've finished the Chapter 7 and I've started to learn Chapter 8 that is "OOP Part 2 - Polymorphism"

## Day19

I'm contiuning to learn OOP Part 2 that is Chapter 8 with Composition
